Any duplication, reproduction or copying any part of the code and/or the entire code (including UC Berkeley students taking the course) without my permission is strictly against UC Berkeley code of conduct (for UC Berkeley students), and can and will count as plagiarism (for everyone). I hold no responsibility should a student (or any other individual) be caught plagiarizing and/or using my code as reference, as the code is made public solely for my professional growth.
